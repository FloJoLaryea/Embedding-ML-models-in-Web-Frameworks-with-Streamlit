  <h1>Retention Radar Streamlit App</h1>

  <p>
This is a Streamlit web application for predicting Vodafone Churn. The app uses a trained machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not based on certain input features.
  </p>



<br />


## :signal_strength: Dataset

The trained dataset is originally from the Telco Datasets. The objective is to predict behavior to retain customers by analyzing all relevant customer data and developing focused customer retention programs. It includes following information:

- Customers who left â€“ the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for â€“ phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information â€“ how long theyâ€™ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers â€“ gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

### Details
- Number of Rows: 5043 (Customers)
- Number of Columns: 21 (Features)
- Class Distribution: (churn value Yes is interpreted as "customer churn")

```

## :play_or_pause_button: Usage

1. Open the app in your web browser and log in.
2. Enter the required information in the input fields.
3. Click the 'Predict' button to generate the prediction.



## :construction: Inputs
Click on the link and reboot the tool or run locally and enter following details such as:

* Tenure (months)
* Phone Service: 0 or 1
* Contract: 0 - Month-to-month, 1 - One year, 2 - Two year
* Paperless Billing: 0 or 1
* Payment Method: 0 - Bank transfer (automatic), 1 - Credit card (automatic), 2 - Electronic check, 3 - Mailed check
* Monthly Charges


## :rocket: Outputs
The app will display following messages:

* "The customer is likely to churn (Yes)." or "The customer is unlikely to churn (No)."
* "The probability of churn is: (X, Y)".
